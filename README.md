Hi! If you're here, it might mean you need to update the FF website without me (John). Im sorry, but to keep costs down I did this the most barebones way, which means that I needed to sacrifice some usability.

I've done my best to leave a trail of breadcrumbs; you can make most minor changes through this website after signing on with the group's email address and password. Once you've done that, if you edit any file on this site it will change the website after a couple of minutes.

The most likely thing you are doing here is adding or amending events. Go to `index.html` and have a look for the lines that start with `<!-- READ_ME`, and follow the instsructions inside.
